Perform the following analysis and generation tasks:

1. **Weaknesses and Optimization Ideas (Summary):**
  - Identify key weaknesses in the profile, including:
    - Generic or vague language
    - Lack of client-centric focus
    - Weak formatting or visual storytelling
    - Poor structure, tone mismatch, or niche confusion
  - Provide actionable, step-by-step suggestions to improve each weakness
  - Reference modern best practices for top-performing freelancer profiles

2. **Optimized Profile Overview (Generated Asset):**
  - Rewrite the profile overview to be compelling, client-focused, and persuasive
  - Clearly communicate what the freelancer does, who they serve, and how they deliver value
  - Use professional but friendly language, and include emojis to increase scannability where appropriate
  - Ensure it reflects the freelancer’s unique personality and competitive edge

3. **Suggested Project Titles and Layouts (Generated Asset):**
  - Provide 3–5 clickable, attractive project titles tailored to their niche
  - Recommend a strong, repeatable case study format such as:
    - Client – Challenge – Solution – Result
    - Problem – Process – Outcome – Testimonial
  - Make the titles benefit-driven and aligned with common client search queries

4. **Recommended Visuals/Layout Hierarchies (Generated Asset):**
  - Suggest the ideal types of visuals (mockups, icons, before/after shots, testimonials, results snapshots, etc.)
  - Recommend a visual hierarchy for the portfolio page:
    - Clear headline & subheading
    - Profile image or intro video
    - Top 3 projects
    - Testimonials and client logos
    - CTA section (e.g., “Let’s Work Together”)

5. **Before and After Comparison (for the overview/headline):**
  - Extract the original profile headline/overview (if present)
  - Show a side-by-side comparison with your rewritten version
  - Briefly explain why the “after” version is more compelling and likely to convert

Return all results in clean **Markdown**, using appropriate headings (###), lists (-, *), bold (**), and other markdown formatting for readability and web display.
